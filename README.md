# üì∏ CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-CNN - Easy Image Classification for Everyone

## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome to the CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN project! This application helps you classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project is built with TensorFlow and Keras, featuring tools for data preprocessing, model training, and impressive visualizations.

- Internet connection for downloading additional libraries

## üñ•Ô∏è Features

- **Image Classification:** Classifies CIFAR-10 images into 10 classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Prepares images for the model effectively.
- **Model Training:** Implements a CNN model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **ROC Curve Visualization:** Displays a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve to analyze model performance.
- **Sample Predictions:** View predictions on sample test images.
- **Custom Image Classification:** Upload and classify your own images.

## üìä Visual Analysis

Visualizing data can be simple and informative. The project includes ROC curve visualizations to help you understand the model's performance clearly. You will see how well the model distinguishes among the different classes.

## üì∏ Custom Image Classification

Want to see how the model performs on your own images? The program allows you to upload an image. Once uploaded, the model will classify it and display the results to you immediately.
